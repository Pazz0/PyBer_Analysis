# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
Using Python and Pandas, we created a breakdown of Data from popular Ridesharing app Pyber! Drilling into data from a CSV file, we created a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type to compare their data and search for trends.
 
Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, we created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 

## Results
We were able to organise the data by each city type and compare their sets of data. The first being amount of drivers:

We see Rural have a small amount while Urban is large!

We were also able to write scripts that could calculate the average fare per ride for each city type:

As well as the average fare per driver for each city type:

We can see Rural has a higher average fare while Urban fares are quite cheaper!

We also created a DataFrame to showcase the summary of findings:

We were able to use Matplotlib to create a plot to showcase the Total Fares by City type for a sample of a few months to visually represent the patterns of data:

We notice something particular in this graph, the lines don't touch! They represent fares for each city and they never intersect. This can help us make decisions to help advance the financial and marketing efforts of the company.  

## Summary
Upon combing through the data we could find patterns between the fares and city types. Our data differs between each city type! 

### Datacentric Reccomendations to CEO

The fact that there's no crossover pricing in fares between city types indicates that the fares of city types could be adjusted. We can raise fares in the Urban city types as they are low and depend on volume of rides. 

The numbers indicate that amount of drivers are many in the Urban setting and few in Rural settings. The company should look to market and hire more Rural drivers so they can provide more rides and in turn lower fare prices to be more on par with the Suburban city type fare pricing.

Seeing the Suburban city type as a constant or average in between Rural and Urban types, the company should strive to align the fare pricing of Rural and Urban cities as well as driver amount closer to the Suburban chart in order to maximize profit while keeping financials and resources balanced. Doing this in an effective manner will in turn create a greater market share and intice new riders into a better fare pricing structure.
